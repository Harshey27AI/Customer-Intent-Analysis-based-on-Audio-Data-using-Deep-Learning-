Customer Intent Analysis based on Telemarketing Calls using Deep Learning
Abstract
This project focuses on analyzing customer intent based on telemarketing calls using deep learning techniques. By leveraging AI-based solutions, we aim to efficiently and accurately process customer data to gain valuable insights into their preferences and demands. The proposed model utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) voice recognition techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify patterns in customer voice data that indicate their intent towards a product. The project involves data collection, labeling, pre-processing, model selection, evaluation, and deployment.
Introduction
Understanding customer intent is crucial for businesses to improve their products, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Traditional methods like surveys and reviews are time-consuming and expensive. This project addresses the need for an efficient and accurate system to analyze customer intent based on telemarketing calls. By employing deep learning algorithms and NLP speech recognition techniques, we aim to provide businesses with real-time insights to enhance their decision-making process.
Real-World Problem
Many companies struggle to understand their customers' intent towards their products, leading to potential losses. Analyzing customer data using AI can help businesses gain valuable insights efficiently and accurately. This project specifically focuses on analyzing customer sentiment based on telemarketing calls, which are commonly used by companies for product marketing.
Aim
The aim of this project is to develop an AI-based model that can predict a customer's intent towards a product by analyzing their voice patterns in telemarketing call recordings. The model will utilize deep learning algorithms and NLP speech recognition techniques to identify patterns indicative of customer intent.
Artificial Intelligence Approach
The project follows a structured approach for audio sentiment analysis using deep learning. The key steps include:

Data Collection: Gathering audio conversations between customers and customer service centers.
Data Labeling: Assigning sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) to each audio sample using an Automatic Sentiment Recognition (ASR) tool.
Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data into a suitable format for deep learning models.
Model Selection: Choosing appropriate deep learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Deployment: Integrating the trained model into the desired application or system for real-time sentiment analysis of audio streams.

Implementation Details
The project implementation involves the following key steps:

Data Labeling: Utilizing the AssemblyAI API for speech-to-text conversion and speaker identification.
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the text data by removing numerical values, special characters, and performing tokenization and lemmatization.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for sentiment analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, applying one-hot encoding, tokenization, padding, and training the CNN model. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
Cross-Validation: Applying cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability.

Future Recommendations
To further enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of audio sentiment analysis for telemarketing calls, the following recommendations are proposed:

Collecting a large-scale audio dataset with diverse customer responses and sentiment labels.
Utilizing spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to represent audio signals.
Incorporating attention mechanisms in deep learning models to focus on critical segments of the audio stream.
Applying data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.
Implementing real-time sentiment analysis during telemarketing calls to provide immediate feedback to telemarketers.

Results and Conclusion
The project achieved promising results, with the deep learning models demonstrating an average accuracy of 81% on the available dataset. The Decision Tree classifier performed exceptionally well, achieving 99% accuracy on the training data. However, more extensive datasets are required to further train and validate the models for improved performance.
The project highlights the potential of AI-based solutions in analyzing customer intent based on telemarketing calls. By leveraging deep learning techniques and NLP speech recognition, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and sentiments, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and enhance customer engagement.
